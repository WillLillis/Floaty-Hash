# Floaty Hash

Ever wanted to use a hash set with floats but ALSO wanted to treat values within a given error tolerance as the *same* number in this case? (Why would you ever try to do this?)

*DISCLAIMER*: Please don't use this in any actual project. It's just a proof of concept of a Friday afternoon "What if?"
